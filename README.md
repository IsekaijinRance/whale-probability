# Whale Probability
This is a repository that that works as a functional implementation of a simple probability problem which some people might get wrong so this is a simple implementation of it in order to find the answer in a practical way other than debating it on paper.

Alternatively, this is also a programming practice which will evolve as i noticed that this problem in particular is a good problem that can be used to practice a couple programming features like multiproccessing and program variables.

## Requirements
 This is a simple script that should work in any python environment that runs python 3.
