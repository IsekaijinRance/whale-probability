# Whale Probability
This is a repository that that works as a functional implementation of a simple probability problem which some people might get wrong so this is a simple implementation of it in order to find the answer in a practical way other than debating it on paper.

Alternatively, this is also a programming practice which will evolve as i noticed that this problem in particular is a good problem that can be used to practice a couple programming features like multiproccessing and program variables.

## Requirements
 This is a simple script that should work in any python environment that runs python 3.

## Licensing
This project code is licensed under the MIT License so you can pretty much do whatever you want with it. The code here should be simple enought that any beginner coder who has basic concepts down should be able to replicate with about an hour of effort.
